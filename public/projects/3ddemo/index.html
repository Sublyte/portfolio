        <h2>ðŸ“œ Details</h2>
        <p>
          As I mentioned on my portfolio, I enjoy designing new and interesting websites. This one uses three.js to bring the website to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          The animations change as you scroll here, for example here you can see:
           The Halo rotates on its own but NOT when you scroll.
           The Borg Cube is drifiting slowly on its own and rotates more when you scroll and the Planet spins on its own aswell as spinning rapidly when you scroll.
        </p>

        <p>
          So much more is possible with this. If you can imagine it. I can build it.
